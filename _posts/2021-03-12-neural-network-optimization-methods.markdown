Russia is a place with an intricate culture. The country is generally cold, but the people don't mind.

The Ural mountains are for sure a sight to see. The mountains are stunning with the snow and formation!

The European part of Russia only takes up around 1/4-1/3 of the country, which means you can go to siberia and be in Asia and not Europe!

An issue now due to the war is the fact that the grocery stores don't have American products. Instead, there are Russian knockoffs.

Overall, Russia is a place of cultural interest to many people, and is what home is called to many people.
