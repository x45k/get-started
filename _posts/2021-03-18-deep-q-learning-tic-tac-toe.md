To start off with, Sweden is a country with temperatures that range from mildly warm to bitterly cold. If your in southern Sweden, like the Stockholm area, the weather is usually very nice, with occasional rain, but that just makes things look even better! The weather is perfect for just going to a cafe, goig for a walk, or anything outside.

The people are also very friendly, and are willing to talk with you, even if they barely know you. They also intently listen to you, and stop what they are doing to just talk with you, and they truly do want to talk with you. They enjoy talking with you, so make some small talk!

Overall, Sweden is a place of many different things, ranging from nice weather, to talking with other people, to just taking a walk, Sweden has a lot to offer.
