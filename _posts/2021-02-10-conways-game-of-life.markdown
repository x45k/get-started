The aborigine have been in Australia for as long as people have known Australia's name. They have been a very important part of the sustaining of the country in its early days, yet they are still fairly unknown.

The new settlers that have come over the years have changed their life styles, but they have worked around it, and figured out how they can still continue their traditional way of living. They do not like the things the new people are doing, barely even know what technology is, yet still keep up their history.

Overall, the aborigine have been an important part of Australia's past, and will be an important part in its future.
