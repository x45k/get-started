description: "All about Brazil!"
---
Recently, I had a school project which requires me to make this so here I am.

The project is about Brazil, as you read beforehand.

I have a couple pieces of information about brazil for you. Starting off, there is not the money to afford common day luxuries like we have in the United States. There is not the availability to just go to a store and buy food, that is not possible in Brazil. The good thing here though is, although there is not money for common day things, there is family, and family in Brazil are very close together.

Another issue that is in brazil is the fact that there are sometimes people left out and bullied. Now the bonus is that there aren't many kids in this position, but there still are, which is a massive issue. People getting left out and treated unfairly rarely changes and could scar a kid for life.

The parents in Brazil are taught to take care of their kids, and make them their first priority, which brings people close together. Now are there still issues with families, yes. But being close together during tough times is extremely important.

Hopefully, with time, these nightmares will be fixed, whether by private foundations, the government, or some other force, this will be a better place with time.
