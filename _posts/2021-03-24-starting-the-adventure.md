Chios, Greece is the known for its mystik trees. Its sap can be used as gum, which is what made the island so famous. Most people go to Chios just to see the mystik, since you know, it's where it comes from. The mystik also brings in most of the islands money, which allows it to continue selling mystik gum.

Besides the fact that it's very well known for its mystik trees, it also has some very nice beaches. The beaches are available to everybody, have nice sand, and water. The city is also mostly empty from tourists, which is a massive bonus for visiting as a tourist, because theres little people like you around, and you get to feel the culture.

All in all, Chios, Greece is an amazing place to visit, ranging from its well known trees, to its beaches, it has everything!
