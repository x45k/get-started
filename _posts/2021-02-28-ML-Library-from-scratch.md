The Basho village in China is a very unique place compared to others in the world. The buildings are of course Chinese, but there is zero lick of western influence in it. It almost feels like they are secluded from the world.

There are also very different child expectations. The children do a lot of work kids in the U.S.A. or Canada don't. The kids go shopping for their parents, the kids go around town to give things to people, a lot of work older people are expected to do. This can be seen as both a positive and a negative to many people, but it is undeniable that it gives kids the chance to learn what it is like being an adult and what they should expect in their lives.

Overall, the people live their lives the same as people here do, they just have a different influence and culture, and have a different way of doing things compared to the rest of the world.
