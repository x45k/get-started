The people in Mexico are mostly Mexican (62%), while 10% are white/European. The growing white population could be a threat to the culture of Mexico, as they could change the way the native Mexicans live.

The country is also by far a Spanish speaking country, with 90% speaking it. The country is mainly thriving on tourism however, which it has many hot spots. The country has little income besides tourism.

Overall, Mexico is an interesting place with many interesting people and ideas, and has made itself well known in the world.
