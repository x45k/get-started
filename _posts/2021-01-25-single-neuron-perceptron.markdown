Thailand is full of interesting cultural differences and beautiful scenery, and one cool place is the Lopburi Monkey Festival. The festival is sponsored by a nearby hotel, which they will contiue to do for a long time. The monkeys are very clingy, and they will cling on to anything they see. They are also very attention seeking.

The monkey festival brings the local people together, and they have fun with a bunch of monkeys that are so funny. The festival occurs every year, and has many visitors, many of which are tourists.

All in all, the Lopburi Monkey Festival is a cool place that gets people together.
