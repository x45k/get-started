Kenya is a place with little stability, and a very weak economy, but like in Brazil, everyone is close together. Family is the only thing that keeps them there, and happy. Their houses are nothing like what we have, often with little to no electricity and power. That means every single thing that is done has to be done without power and electricity.

An extra struggle is having to grow all of your own food since the economy is so weak. Nobody has money for food, meaning they have to grow it themselves, and that isn't enough for multiple people. This is a common trend throughout Africa.

Overall, its tough to live in somewhere like Kenya, but family brings people together, and thats what matters the most to the people in Kenya.
